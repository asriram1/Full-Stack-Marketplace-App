- on ad/id page if user not owner of product, then instead
of having sizes as text - make it a select input
- When add to cart clicked, if not selected size prompt
user to select size

- in cart page, show selected size as selected value, and allow
change through select.

- on order - add value for size selected.
- display on orders page and orders/id page. 


- Add size to Order and print on order/id page
- Create Checkout failure page & link to api/checkout
- Add to cart text on button
- Showing size: for accessories on /cart page (also order/id page maybe)
